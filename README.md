This repository is incomplete and not ready for use.

The project was stopped due to the inability to add a function to read compressed requests (zstd, br, gzip, etc.) and display them to the user.

You can found read response function in `main.py` file `forward` function.

The certificates and private keys located in the `certs` folder will be deleted, and new certificates and keys will be added if the project is completed.


I could finish the project, but I chose to leave it as is because it's extremely exhausting, and no single person can complete this project.

Contributions to this repository are welcome.
